# Python - Hello, World!

This repository contains introductory projects for learning Python programming at Holberton School.

## Description of Tasks

### 0. Run Python file

This task involves writing a Shell script that executes a Python script. The name of the Python file is stored in an environment variable named $PYFILE.

**File:** `0-run`

### 1. Run inline

This task involves writing a Shell script that executes inline Python code. The Python code to be executed is stored in an environment variable named $PYCODE.

**File:** `1-run_inline`

### 2. Hello, print

This task involves writing a Python script that prints a specific string: "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle". The string is printed exactly as specified, followed by a new line.

**File:** `2-print.py`

### 3. Print integer

In this task, you will complete the source code to print an integer stored in a variable named `number`, followed by "Battery street", and a new line. The code must be 3 lines long and use f-strings.

**File:** `3-print_number.py`

### 4. Print float

The goal here is to complete the source code to print a float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits. The output should start with "Float:", followed by the float rounded to 2 decimal places, and a new line. f-strings must be used.

**File:** `4-print_float.py`

### 5. Print string

This task requires you to complete the source code to print a string stored in the variable `str` three times, followed by its first 9 characters. The code should not use any loops or conditional statements and must be 5 lines long.

**File:** `5-print_string.py`

### 6. Play with strings

In this task, you will complete the source code to print "Welcome to Holberton School!" by concatenating two variables `str1` and `str2`. The code should not use any loops or conditional statements and must be 5 lines long.

**File:** `6-concat.py`

### 7. Copy - Cut - Paste

This task involves completing the source code to extract specific parts of a string stored in the variable `word`. The code should print the first 3 letters, the last 2 letters, and all letters except the first and last ones. The code should not use any loops or conditional statements and must be 8 lines long.

**File:** `7-edges.py`


8. Create a new sentence

    - This task involves completing a Python source code to print the phrase "object-oriented programming with Python", followed by a new line. The constraints are as follows:
        - No loops or conditional statements are allowed.
        - The program must be exactly 5 lines long.
        - No new variables can be created.
        - String literals are not allowed.

**File:** `8-concat_edges.py`


### 9. Easter Egg

- This task requires writing a Python script that prints "The Zen of Python," by Tim Peters, followed by a new line. The constraints are as follows:
    - The script should be a maximum of 98 characters long.

**File:** `9-easter_egg.py`

## Requirements


- The first line of all your Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- The first line of all your shell files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- All your files should end with a new line.
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.8.*)
